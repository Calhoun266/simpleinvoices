Simple Invoices - Roadmap
</title>
</head>
To Do
<ul>
Stage 1: 
 - Basic implementation
 -- Add the fields, Total, Paid and Owing to the Manage Invoices and Manage Customers page
 -- Add Process Payment option to Manage Invoices, Client details, and Quick View
 -- Client details: show in the client details page the list of all the invoices for that client and there payment stats.
 -- Quick View: add a payment details for the invoice and show a summary of that customers Total, Paid and Owing stats
 
Stage 2:
 - Add an Accounts/Payments menu
 - Create a Process Payment page where you can select an invoice and process a payment (different from the process_payment in Stage 1)
 - Create a Batch process payment where you can process say 10 payments at once
 - Create a Manage Payments screen where you can view sort all the payments - Non editable - but can add payments from here
 - Reports: create some basic reports to report on payments
 
Stage 3:
 - Reports: create more advanced and detailed reports
 -- ie, Days overdue reports etc.
 - ? New Invoice - look at adding an autocalc js into the New Invoice page and maybe add a payment fields there - so its an all-in-one page
 - Add a tick box into the New Invoice pages to say: mark invoice as paid in full" so it'll automatically process a payment for the total of the invoices - Usefull for generating receipts
 
Stage 4:
 - Add in the Quick View a 'Generate' option to enable the printing/pdf/xls/etc.. of any other invoice preference 
 -- ie. there'll be a drop down list - if if you created and invoice - you'll be able to select 'Receipt' from the list and it'll print(or whatever action you select) a Receipt of the Invoice 
 
Stage 5:
 - Manage Invoices - add a days overdue field
 - Add a System deault ?/maybe? where you can specify the default payment period and base the overdue stats off that and the invoice create data
