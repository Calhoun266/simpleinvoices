hi,
try to look into Drupal source for SQL functions. If you are GNU/GPL too, you can even adopt it :-)

The point is, that EVERY user inputted string must go through some escaping function:

<?php

$user = $_GET['user']; // $_POST['user'] // this is VERY vulnerable $result = MySQL_Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $user"); // this is NOT vulnerable $result = MySQL_Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '".mysql_real_escape_string($user)."'");

while ($row = MySQL_Fetch_Array($result)) {
  // this IS vulnerable to XSS
  print_r($row);
  // this IS NOT vulnerable to XSS
  htmlspecialchars(print_r($row));
}
?>
