=== 2010.2 beta series ===

==== current bugs ====
 * http://simpleinvoices.org/forum/discussion/1176/feedback-20102-beta-2/
   * ~~“Custom Fields” management is not working. I followed your instructions in the FAQ and modified the PHP error reporting level but this made no difference.~~ fixed
   * ~~"User Management". If you do not assign a Role when adding a new user the user does not appear in the user list, effectively they are 'lost' to the system. The only way to bring them back is manually edit the database~~ Done
   * I've created 3 documents; an invoice, an estimate and another invoice (in that order). Each document has its own numbering group so I have Invoice 1 and Invoice 2, and Estimate 1. However when I try to e-mail documents the auto-generated subject line is not using the numbering group i.e. when I e-mail Estimate 1 it shows the subject line as "Estimate 2" and Invoice 2 as "Invoice 3".
   * 0 size PDFs when being emaield
