#Release how-to.

= Current SVN structure =

 * /trunk
 * /branches/stable
 * /branches/stable-'release or feature dev name'

The process I have used to do releases of SimpleInvoices is

 * when trunk is getting close to stable branch to /branches with the planned release name ie. /branches/2012-1
 * and finalise the code there and release
 * merge changes between /trunk and the release branch as needed to make it all happy pre prelease

If this a release when lots of changes I do a number of beta releases to make sure everything is working as expected and iron out any final bugs

If all looks OK with the current code I do the release
 * get john from teammc - hes on the Si lists- to do a windows version
 * upload to google code
 * announce on forum
 * announce on blog
 * announce on email lists

Then continue to work on trunk

If trunk is a away off getting stable and there are pressing issues I do a copy of the release branch and make it as Update 1 or the next release up (with bugs fix in this branch and trunk)

then repeat!!
