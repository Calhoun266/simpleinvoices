== ... enable the login system ==

Simple Invoices has an optional login system to allow you to protect your install of Simple Invoices with a username/password system.

If you are using a version of Simple Invoices later than 2007 08 then all you have to do is edit config/config.ini and set authentication.enabled to true.

To do this just change the file from
{{{
authentication.enabled	       = false
}}}

to
{{{
authentication.enabled	       = true
}}}

For more information see here: http://simpleinvoices.org/config#authentication

That's it - you can login with:

|| Email address || demo@simpleinvoices.org ||
|| Password || demo ||

Since Simple Invoices 2009.1 you can edit a username and password within Simple Invoices - go to the People tab and select Users.

For developers: The password is hashed in the DB with MD5(new_password).
