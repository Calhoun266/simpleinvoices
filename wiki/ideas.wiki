   * backup to a web directory is not really a good idea. Perhaps the download solution is a better one:
     * just mod the existing backup script to dump to screen or download file - same as how phpmyadmin dumps to screeen - in a text box
     * mod headers as in your example
{{{
		<?php
		include('config.php');

		$conn = mysql_connect( $host, $user, $password );
		mysql_select_db( $database, $conn );
		$name = date("ymd")."_tillbackup.sql";
		$backupFile = "/tmp/{$name}";

		system("/sw/bin/mysqldump --user=$user --pass=$password $database > $backupFile");

		header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$name");
		header("Content-type: unknown/unknown");

		include($backupFile);

		unlink($backupFile);
		?>
}}}
