==Default Invoice Extension==

===About===

This extension allows you to create new invoices, based on an existing one.

===Details===

When this extension is enabled, the following happens:

In the Manage Customers, the last invoice of each customer is shown (in an extra column). In the Manage Customers page, the action 'Add invoice' is available.

When Add invoice is clicked, the new invoice (itemised style) is created as normal, but then prefilled with the contents of the template invoice. Recurring invoices are made easy, though still manual. The only items not from the template are the invoice date and the invoice number.

The invoice is added once the 'save' button is hit.

By default, the template invoice number is stored in custom userfield customer_cf4
