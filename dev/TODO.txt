 - User admin 
 - Biller login
 - Customer payments - accept via Paypal etc..
 - Product Cost field - http://simpleinvoices.org/forum/discussion/687/product-cost-price-field 
 - Simple Invoices Errors - make a function and make look all pretty (ie cache read only, no PDO, no PHP5.2, can't connect to Db etc..) - AP
 - Address fields in invoice templates - include comma after add 1 or 2 if other address field not null
 - users/groups/domains - make this happen!
 - user admin ui
 - preferences: move rest into db
 - submit : update all refer to submit to better - only some done - all needs to be done and work

### Below here are mainly ideas we should look at but nothing(or little) has been done ###

############################################
SOMETIME IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE TODOs
############################################

 - blow up phpreports and implement our own reporting tools
 - reports : add export to .xls format 
 - docs.php: merge docs.php into the normal system
 - choose automatic language (need to rename language files/subfolder). We should use this standards (first we can start with only 2 chars variant)
 -- http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt
 -- http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry
 --- sounds good - aim for NR+1
 ---- use in the installer and i'll think about it for the login page when/if i add a lang drop down box there
 - Localise - look into Zend Locale or similar to handle localising all the formatting of dates, currency etc.

##############################
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE TODOs
##############################

- Reports
-- Date based reports : http://simpleinvoices.org/forum/topic-391.html ( payments received today, invoices made today etc..) - AP
-- Customer : Statement of Accounts : http://simpleinvoices.org/forum/topic-414.html - AP
- Cache - investigate more cache option - apc, memcache, pdo cache option - cache as much as possible - AP
- add due date for sending bills via e-mail (cron-script)
- in pop-down menus the preselected entry is always twice. change it with the selected option
 -- i couldnt do this nicely :) if you could would be great
- use utf-8 for e-mail sending - check this - AP
- thinking about user/groups. Extendebal system and connection with other database should be possible -> All throught 1 interface
- backup to a web directory is not really a good idea. Perhaps the download solution is a better one:
  -- just mod the existing backup script to dump to screen or download file - same as how phpmyadmin dumps to screeen - in a text box
  -- mod headers as in your example

		<?php
		include('config.php');

		$conn = mysql_connect( $host, $user, $password );
		mysql_select_db( $database, $conn );
		$name = date("ymd")."_tillbackup.sql";
		$backupFile = "/tmp/{$name}";

		system("/sw/bin/mysqldump --user=$user --pass=$password $database > $backupFile");

		header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$name");
		header("Content-type: unknown/unknown");

		include($backupFile);

		unlink($backupFile);
		?>

- Admin-Funtion: Cache Cleanup
- What happens if a page is longer then 1 page for printing? (header,footer?)
- Make custom_fields dynamic with the following tables
	customFieldsCategorie
	id,name (product,customer,biller,...)
	
	customFields
	id,categorieId,itemId,value

	customFieldsValues
	id,cateogireId,customFieldId,itemId,value

	customFieldType (can be added as plugin or so...)
	id, name, 

- Store Menu in the database...


- defining for every module an id?
- customFieldPlugin Id's have to be unique. 0 - 100 for shipping plugins. Other numbers can be choosen with attention (public list?)
