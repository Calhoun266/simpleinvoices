SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE TODOs
##############################

- Reports
-- Date based reports : http://simpleinvoices.org/forum/topic-391.html ( payments received today, invoices made today etc..) - AP
-- Customer : Statement of Accounts : http://simpleinvoices.org/forum/topic-414.html - AP
- Cache - investigate more cache option - apc, memcache, pdo cache option - cache as much as possible - AP
- add due date for sending bills via e-mail (cron-script)
- in pop-down menus the preselected entry is always twice. change it with the selected option
 -- i couldnt do this nicely :) if you could would be great
- use utf-8 for e-mail sending - check this - AP
- thinking about user/groups. Extendebal system and connection with other database should be possible -> All throught 1 interface
- backup to a web directory is not really a good idea. Perhaps the download solution is a better one:
  -- just mod the existing backup script to dump to screen or download file - same as how phpmyadmin dumps to screeen - in a text box
  -- mod headers as in your example

		<?php
		include('config.php');

		$conn = mysql_connect( $host, $user, $password );
		mysql_select_db( $database, $conn );
		$name = date("ymd")."_tillbackup.sql";
		$backupFile = "/tmp/{$name}";

		system("/sw/bin/mysqldump --user=$user --pass=$password $database > $backupFile");

		header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$name");
		header("Content-type: unknown/unknown");

		include($backupFile);

		unlink($backupFile);
		?>

- Admin-Funtion: Cache Cleanup
- What happens if a page is longer then 1 page for printing? (header,footer?)
- Make custom_fields dynamic with the following tables
	customFieldsCategorie
	id,name (product,customer,biller,...)
	
	customFields
	id,categorieId,itemId,value

	customFieldsValues
	id,cateogireId,customFieldId,itemId,value

	customFieldType (can be added as plugin or so...)
	id, name, 

- Store Menu in the database...


- defining for every module an id?
- customFieldPlugin Id's have to be unique. 0 - 100 for shipping plugins. Other numbers can be choosen with attention (public list?)
