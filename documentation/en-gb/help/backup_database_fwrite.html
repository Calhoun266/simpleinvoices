<b>Got fwrite() errors?</b><br>
<p>
If you received fwrite() errors when atempting to backup your Simple Invoices database this means that the webserver user(hopefully your running Apache) doesn't have read/write permissions to the tmp/database_backups directory in the Simple Invoices folder<br>
<br>
Please change the permissions on this directory and attempt the backup again.  To change the permissions of the tmp/database_backups directory in Unix/Linix/OSX cd to the Simple Invoice directory (<i>cd /var/www/html/simpleinvoices</i>)
and then issue the chmod command to give the webserver user read/write permissions (<i>chmod -Rv 777 tmp/database_backups</i>)
