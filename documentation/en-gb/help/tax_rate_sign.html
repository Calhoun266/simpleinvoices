<p>A tax can be either a percentage based (ie. Sales Tax 10%) or a flat money values (ie. $10 or Â£20).

<p>
 The $ in the drop down only indicates that this will be a flat money rate and it doesnt indicate the currency symbol.  The 'invoice preference' that you use dictates what the currency symbol will be in your invoices</p>
