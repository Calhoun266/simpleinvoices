@ruflin (notes):
- make system defaults table nicer (name,value,id, ...)
- add due date for sending bills via e-mail (cron-script)
- make $tb_prefix a global constant to be accessible in all functions (without global)
- in pop-down menus the preselected entry is always twice. change it with the selected option
 -- i couldnt do this nicely :) if you could would be great
- use utf-8 for e-mail sending
- redesign of documentation (global and internal)
- custom-field redesign? more flexible?
- Search for invoice?
  - the goal of the new ajax grid is to have this via filters - refer link for example
  -- http://dowdybrown.com/dbprod/rico2/examples/php/ex3.php
  -- what do u think?
- invoices longer then 1 page? repeat header?
- backup to a web directory is not really a good idea. Perhaps the download solution is a better one:
  -- just mod the existing backup script to dump to screen or download file - same as how phpmyadmin dumps to screeen - in a text box
  -- mod headers as in your example

<?php
include('config.php');

$conn = mysql_connect( $host, $user, $password );
mysql_select_db( $database, $conn );
$name = date("ymd")."_tillbackup.sql";
$backupFile = "/tmp/{$name}";

system("/sw/bin/mysqldump --user=$user --pass=$password $database > $backupFile");

header("Content-disposition: attachment; filename=$name");
header("Content-type: unknown/unknown");

include($backupFile);

unlink($backupFile);
?>




- Replace
if (!defined("BROWSE")) {
   echo "You Cannot Access This Script Directly, Have a Nice Day.";
   exit();
}
- with
checkLogin();
